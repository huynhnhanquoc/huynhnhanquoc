## **The Beginning — From Angular to a Simpler Dream**

Today, I want to share the story of Kit JS, a tiny JavaScript framework I built by hand.It’s still in its experimental phase — plenty left to optimize, extend, and refine — but I’m sharing it now in the spirit of #buildinpublic and #opencoding.

I used to be an Angular Developer — back in the days of Angular 4 to 8.  
I loved Angular deeply... until I realized how **unfriendly it was for SEO**.

That realization pushed me toward **static websites** — lightweight, pre-rendered, secure, and beautifully simple.

Then I discovered **JAMstack** — a fresh way of thinking about the web.  
But the deeper I went, the louder one question became:

> “Why do we need an entire ecosystem, complex builds, and tens of thousands of dependencies just to make a simple website?”

Meanwhile, in **Golang**, my current love language, I saw something different:  
A web app could be just a few `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files — rendered by templates, instantly understood by the browser.

## **Looking Back at the Age of All-Powerful JavaScript**

Once, websites were simple — built with PHP, WordPress, or static files — and they worked perfectly fine.  
Then came the age of “all-powerful” frameworks: React, Vue, Angular… each strong in its own way, yet often burdened by unnecessary complexity.

I began to wonder:

> “Why can’t we go back to something simpler — like AngularJS (Angular 1)?  
> A lightweight framework for dynamic web pages — no build, no setup, just run.”

That’s when the idea of **Dynamic Stack** was born — “dynamic only where it truly needs to be.”

After years of experiments — from Vue to Web Components, then abandoning them all to write in **vanilla JS** — I finally returned with a new perspective.  
More mature.  
And, perhaps, more *dreamy*.

## **Kit JS — Pure, Simple, and Alive**

**Kit JS** was built for one person first — me.

Its purpose is simple:

> “Make JavaScript feel as easy as the first day we learned HTML — one `<script>` tag and a single line of code to make magic happen.”

No build.  
No Node.  
No complex configs.  
Just simplicity — like the **old days of jQuery**, when you could drop a CDN link and start coding immediately.

**Kit JS** isn’t here to compete.  
It doesn’t want to be the next “all-in-one framework.”  
It’s just a small companion — to help you code faster, understand deeper, and bring your HTML to life.

Because I believe the best security still starts at the **server**.  
That’s why Kit JS avoids dangerous patterns like `eval` or `new Function`, stays **CSP-compliant**, and works in **any environment**.

## **A Framework of Feelings, Not Just Technology**

For me, **Kit JS** isn’t just code.  
It’s a piece of a dream — a dream of those early web days when we’d open a `.html` file, write a few lines of JS, save, and *watch it come alive*.

No builds.  
No terminals.  
No pipelines.  
Just code, a browser, and that quiet “wow” moment when creation breathes.

## **Whispers Across the Desert**

Recently, I read a story about a “shark” from my hometown — and it reminded me of something someone once said:

> “What you’re doing is just a grain of sand in the desert.  
> Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.”

Maybe they’re right.  
But if no one dares to try, the desert will remain only sand.  
And if I take a single step, at least there’ll be a **footprint** there — mine.

I’m not here to teach or preach.  
I’m just a guy who loves **code**, loves the **beauty of logic**, and loves the **feeling of building**.

Even when the world is loud, even when people call you crazy — keep building. Keep dreaming.

Because only the one who drinks the water knows if it’s hot or cold.

## **Who Are You?**

A builder? A developer?  
Or maybe… just a dreamer?

Whoever you are — if you still have passion, if you still dare to begin — you’ve already succeeded.

Because success isn’t money or fame.  
It’s the courage to begin **your own journey**.

**Kit JS** isn’t a revolution.  
It’s just a small dream — written in JavaScript — by a developer who still believes in the magic of creating.

## A Kindred Spirit

It’s been a long time since I talked to someone who shares the same wavelength.  
Even though our conversation was only online, it felt as if we could clearly see each other’s path.

We met through a thread.  
I don’t know what to call this relationship.  
Maybe, since we first encountered each other in a BuildInPublic group, we could call ourselves indie hackers.

But why do I title this piece *“The Dream of Indie Coders”*?  
Perhaps it’s because of where we come from.  
We are young people chasing our own dreams, feeling *alive* when we code and follow our passion.

We might have to work harder than others to reach what we truly desire — that is, to live fully within our own dream.

## Vanilla JS and Early Ambitions

Lately, I’ve met many developers still using Vanilla JS.  
While most run after frameworks, we choose a different path.

Five years ago, I returned to Tam Kỳ and began coding the purest version of my dream — with Golang and Vanilla JS.  
Recently, I started releasing a small library (or framework, depending on how you see it) called **Kit JS**.

Yet, I want to preserve the purity, the raw power of Vanilla JS, carrying it forward while combining it with SSR capabilities.

I didn’t write this library to compete or change the world.  
I just wanted to reconnect with the original strength of these languages — a way to remember where I came from.

Like the story of backend languages trying their hand at frontend — it can work in some ways, like with WebAssembly — but it’s not everything, and certainly not a complete full-stack solution.

I once thought deep learning in programming meant mastering frameworks or flashy languages like TypeScript.  
But the more I code, creating small libraries to solve simple tasks, the more I realize:

*“Learning deeply is learning the fundamentals first.”*

## Today

Today is a rushed coding day.  
I am expanding the core of Kit JS and deleting lines of code I spent hours writing — much like the ninth time I refactor my Golang system.

I used to ask myself:

*“Who will recognize this? Who will pay for this?”*

Now, I no longer seek an answer.  
My heart has already answered.

Sometimes, a developer’s happiness is simply sitting in a café, amidst bustling people, yet keeping a heart fully devoted to passion.  
Sunlight kisses the streets, and a foolish dream is guided by the heart.

## We — Seekers of Tiny Happiness

We chase ambitions, smiles, and a small happiness in every line of code.  
Every tiny snippet contributes to the world beyond our screens.

I’ve asked myself:

*“Why do I exist in this world?”*

Perhaps many coders have asked the same.  
If we had a “platform” handed to us, would we still dare to dream?

Tomorrow, the sun will bloom again — like a flower spreading its fragrance across the sky.  
Just like us, still seeking our own happiness.

That happiness might just be a small dream — of one or many indie coders.

## Code, Low-Code, or No-Code at All

The world remains beautiful — beautiful because we can draw our dreams in code.

I will step outside and enjoy a sunny day.  
The sun still dreams, and the code keeps flowing.

Clouds — true to their name — are just clouds.  
And perhaps life, too, drifts along those clouds.

We are just small developers, seeking happiness in coding, contributing, and leaving a mark in the world.

Out there, some have fame, titles, and recognition.  
We — the foolish ones — only have hearts that resonate and mutual respect for our craft.  
I have always looked up to Linus as a giant in that sense.

## Hearts of Laughing Fools

Today, the wind may not stir the trees, but sunlight peeks through after a sudden rain.  
If we could, we would code for a lifetime.

He once told me:

*“The happiest days are Friday and Saturday — the days I get to do something just for myself.”*

I am luckier — I don’t “sell myself,” because I indulge my foolish heart and make it suffer sometimes.  
But neither of us has another choice.  
Because we have no “platform.”

Ah, yes — we do.  
Our platform is the dream — the dream of foolish indie coders, delightfully naive.

I always hope that other builders will keep moving forward.  
Step by step.

If you walk towards the sun, you will feel its warmth.  
And if you walk against the sun, the light will still follow.

Every step has a reason to begin.  
And perhaps, we all started somewhere — with a small dream.

*— Written on a sunny morning, with keystrokes echoing in rhythm with the heartbeat.*

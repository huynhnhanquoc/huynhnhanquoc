## It All Started with a Spark

Almost ten years ago, I witnessed something that changed my life — a friend working as a freelance web developer.  
I didn’t understand what he was doing. I just saw lines of code dancing across his screen and heard him talk about clients, projects, and earning money online.

That moment lit a spark. I opened **Blogspot**, started tinkering, and slowly realized that *programming* was basically writing code that made information appear on a screen. Simple, but magical.

## Searching for Direction in University

When I entered university, I began to shape my identity as an IT student.  
In those early days, **C#** fascinated me. Writing tiny applications that calculated formulas and displayed numbers made me feel like I was bending reality a little.

In the university library, I even wrote my first thesis project in **C#** — clumsy, basic, but deeply personal.  
I was like a child who had just found a new world. I knew what *passion* was, but I didn’t yet understand what I was truly pursuing.

## Discovering New Technologies

Then came **WPF**, and with it, the beauty of user interfaces. I fell in love with how design could make code *feel* alive.  
But spending hours adjusting UI elements felt exhausting. So I asked myself:

> “Is there a way to write code once and run it everywhere?”

That question led me to **Xamarin**, though I quickly realized how hard it was to learn alone. I even wondered, *“Why do we need XAML when we already have HTML?”*  
A naive question — but it led me to **Ionic**.

With **Ionic**, I started building mobile apps and learning how to manage data. **Google Sheets** became my backend playground. I discovered that everything revolved around **JSON** — and one day, I realized JSON wasn’t just data… it was *an API*.

From there, I dove into **NoSQL** and **SQL**, opening a whole new chapter in understanding how data truly works.

## Learning and Growing Along the Way

After exploring **Ionic** and **Angular**, I joined a small team in Saigon called **eye-solution**.  
Working alongside other developers taught me more than any tutorial ever could. But I also realized how much I still didn’t know.

Eventually, I moved back to my hometown, focusing on self-learning and building my own projects.  
Through these experiments, I learned something valuable — **Angular** could build powerful apps, but it wasn’t SEO-friendly.  
Static websites, on the other hand, performed better on Google.

By early **2019**, a friend from my hometown introduced me to **Golang**. He needed a remote developer, and I was curious.  
That’s when I started learning **Go**, cloud scripting, and even pointers (which, surprisingly, made sense!).  
I realized Go was simple yet elegant — but I still felt slow in catching up with new technologies.

## Building My Own Projects and Finding My Voice

After several failed job hunts, I turned inward — building my own products.  
I combined everything I’d learned from **Angular** and **Golang**, but again, SEO was my bottleneck.

Then, in **2019**, I discovered the idea of **auto-generated code**.  
If you know **ChatGPT**, you’ll get the idea — it’s a generative model.  
My experiment, however, was about *auto-generating APIs* from data tables.  
That realization changed everything.

The deeper I went, the more I realized Angular couldn’t satisfy my SEO needs.  
So I explored **JAMstack**, **GatsbyJS**, **NuxtJS**, and **Next.js**.  
Could Angular coexist with JAMstack? I had to find out.

Around that time, I discovered **Gohugo**, a framework built with **Golang**.  
A few friends and I started a small project together, but then the pandemic hit.  
Everything slowed down. I went home again — feeling lost, but still dreaming.

## Reconnecting with Purpose

I asked myself:

> “What am I really searching for?”

The answer came slowly: I wanted to build a **website platform** to manage and process data — something elegant, efficient, and truly mine.  
So I started building it, with **Golang** as my constant companion.

I experimented with **Rust** and **Vlang**, but in the end, **Golang** felt like home.  
My goal was simple: create a platform to manage clients, like **WordPress** or **Shopify**, but from scratch.  
Even if it never became huge, at least I’d make a living doing what I loved — building on the web.

## Where I Am Now

Today, my system has evolved into a **fully functional website platform**, and I’m expanding it toward **business management systems**.  
All the questions I once asked have become the motivation behind my work.

My ultimate goal?  
To build a **multi-platform application** — user-friendly, capable of processing diverse data types, and as beautiful as a modern website.

> The indie journey isn’t about speed — it’s about direction.  
> Every mistake, every detour, every quiet night of debugging brings you closer to your truth as a builder.

And that truth, for me, lies somewhere between a simple Go function and a dream that never stops compiling.

Today, I can finally look back with gratitude and forward with hope.  
This journey isn’t just mine — it’s a small reflection of what many indie developers go through when they chase meaning through code.

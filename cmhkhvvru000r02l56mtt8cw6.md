## 🌙 A Journey I Chose to Walk

*Technological independence* — that’s the journey I want to take.  
I want to build something that reflects the vision I believe in.

We only live once, and that ideal — that fire — deserves to be pursued more than once.

From childhood until my twenties, I’ve always been searching for a path of my own.  
Technology wasn’t something I was naturally good at.  
But I remember the first moment I touched my passion — six years ago.

I was just a curious kid who loved to play — and then suddenly, I was asking myself,  
**“What is HTML?”**

That was the first and perhaps the most naïve question of my developer life.

What I was doing felt small — as small as I was.  
There were countless times I was tired, frustrated, and ready to give up.  
But I kept reminding myself:

> “Never stop trying.”

## ☕️ The Bitterness That Keeps You Awake

Dreams are like undefined functions — you never know if they’ll ever return a value.  
But loving, nurturing, and living within that dream — that’s happiness you can’t trade for anything.

People once told me:

> “Your life is bitterer than a cup of coffee.”

And maybe it is.  
But I love coffee — bitter, yes, but real.  
It’s the kind of bitterness that keeps you awake and alive.

I still believe in one thing:

> “If you don’t have talent, how could you ever have luck?”

In real life, I either talk a lot — or not at all.  
People like me are often misunderstood,  
and few truly get what we’re trying to say.

## 📝 Why I Write

They say developers don’t need to write.  
But writing is how I *store emotion* —  
how I document thoughts, and transmit the philosophies behind the code.

If over the past five years I had managed to fully build my platform,  
maybe I wouldn’t have written hundreds of “Only me” blog posts.

I write to remember.  
I write to keep my motivation alive.  
I write to remind myself why I started walking this path.

## 💡 The Way of Trying

Trying is the only way to earn the right to accept or reject tomorrow.

People like me — people still young —  
don’t really know what else to do besides keep trying.

That’s our only way forward,  
our only way to make tomorrow a bit brighter.

The baggage we carry isn’t heavy —  
just some **passion**, and a few **dreams** we lost somewhere along the way.

Youth is like that — full of arrogance, ambition,  
and that naive desire to change the world,  
even when people around you tell you to “go wash dishes.”

## 🌸 The Happiness of Small Things

Happiness at this age is simple:  
to wake up and work on something you love.  
To feel a small spark in your heart —  
because even small happiness can move the world.

If you can watch flowers bloom in spring,  
hear birds sing,  
and see petals fall gently on a quiet lake —  
then even the coldest winter  
is just another breeze passing by.

## 🌤 A Dream Thrown to the Sky

Every wish we make is like throwing a piece of our heart into the sky.

I dream not of fame,  
but of bringing happiness to others —  
and to myself.

That’s my pursuit.  
That’s my foolish, beautiful dream.

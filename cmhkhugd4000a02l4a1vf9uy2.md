## 🌊 Where It All Began — Da Nang

In **2019**, in **Da Nang** — often called *Vietnam’s most livable city* — my journey into technology began.

I was in my early twenties, burning with passion and the wild belief that I could build a platform that would change the world.

Those were the days when I worked until time disappeared —  
leaving home before dawn, arriving at the office as the first sunlight hit the windows, and returning only when the city lights had long awakened.

What was I chasing?  
Perhaps a dream too fragile to explain — a dream only a kindred soul could understand.

In those lonely nights, I gave myself a name: **Song** — like a reflection in a mirror. Solitary, but steadfast.

I dreamed of building a **startup** that could write code powerful enough to shift the world.  
But then, the dream collapsed. The startup failed.  
And I was left with nothing but my two hands and the lingering echo of that fire.

I went back to my hometown — **Tam Ky** — carrying failure, but also a small, unextinguished flame.  
That’s when I realized:

> The dream was never gone.  
> It was just waiting for me to be strong enough to continue it.

## 🌙 Living Two Lives

Back then, I lived as two different people.

By day, I worked as a **delivery driver**, surviving one order at a time.  
By night, I sat in my small room, fingers typing lines of code as if they were lifelines holding me together.

I built **websites** to keep my servers alive.  
Tried **affiliate marketing** just to make ends meet.  
There were nights when my body felt broken, but the fire in my heart wouldn’t let me stop.

Because I believed:  
If I could keep the passion alive — if I could endure —  
one day my dream of a **Golang-based independent platform** would come true.

## 🧭 Learning Again — From the Roots

There was a time I believed **Angular** or **RxJS** could solve everything.  
But I soon realized — depending too much on frameworks only distances you from the essence of programming.

When I faced **SEO challenges**, I discovered the quiet strength of **static web pages**.

So I returned to **Golang** — a language that felt solid, free, and close to who I was.  
At the same time, I forced myself to **relearn JavaScript from the ground up**.

No skipping fundamentals.  
No hiding behind frameworks.  
Just me and the **DOM**, learning to manipulate it, writing small libraries to solve my own problems.

That’s when I understood:

> Frameworks are tools.  
> Real power lies in how you think.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Stack Web — From Idea to Reality

I started with **static websites**, tuned for SEO — but I didn’t want to stop there.  
I wanted them to **live**, to breathe, to become real applications.

The concept of **hydration** in **Jamstack** inspired me —  
a server delivering static HTML that **JavaScript wakes up** into a dynamic experience.

I built my own interpretation and called it **Dynamic Stack Web** —  
a system combining the reliability of the **server** and the flexibility of the **client**.

In this model, **JavaScript** is no longer the whole story —  
just one piece of a much bigger picture.

## 💡 Lessons From the Journey

From **Da Nang** to **Tam Ky**,  
from bitter failure to countless nights in front of my laptop,  
I’ve learned three timeless truths:

1. **Perseverance** is the flame that never dies.
2. **Failure** is a harsh but honest teacher.
3. **Problem-solving mindset** matters more than any technology.

Technology changes every day.  
But patience and clarity — they take you the farthest.

## 🌱 Spreading the Dream

Today, my dream is no longer a private one.  
I want to **share it** — the spirit of open coding, open learning, and open creation.

To tell my story not to impress, but to remind others:  
If you’re quietly building something, nurturing your dream alone,  
you are not alone.

I no longer dream of redefining the world.  
I dream of **redefining myself** —  
and if, along the way, I can touch a few like-minded souls,  
that’s already happiness enough.

## ☀️ Memories That Stay

**Da Nang** — the city where my tech dream was once forgotten —  
is now a memory I can’t separate from who I am.

It reminds me:  
No matter how many times you fall,  
as long as the fire in your heart still burns,  
your dream will never disappear.

Every day I sit down and type the first few lines of code,  
I know I’m alive —  
truly alive — in a simple, quiet kind of happiness.

I still remember the afternoons in Da Nang,  
sunlight pouring through the trees along **Tran Phu Street**.

Back then, I dreamed of success.  
But today, I understand something deeper:

> Growth is the truest success.

For me, success is no longer a spotlight.  
It’s peace.  
It’s sharing.  
It’s nurturing a dream —  
and doing my small part to make this world a little better.

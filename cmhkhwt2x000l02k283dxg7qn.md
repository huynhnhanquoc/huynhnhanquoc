## 🌤 The Year of Quiet Joy

2020 was the year I felt the most **joyful** and **at peace** with myself.

Some of the things I built might sound a little crazy.  
But I was happy — deeply happy — doing them.

There were moments I asked, *What does success really mean? What have I truly done?*

That year, I solved **four major problems** in my field (IT).  
They didn’t make me rich, not immediately — but I know they carry value for the future.

### 🧠 Problem #1: DNS Distribution

For years, I couldn’t figure out how to distribute a **Domain Name System (DNS)**.  
In 2020, I finally did it — the idea inspired by **Firebase Hosting**.

### 🌳 Problem #2: Root Pointer

I created a new concept called **Root Pointer** — think of it like the *root of the DOM*,  
but abstracted into the system level.  
You can call it anywhere in your project, globally.  
The idea came from **context-based architectures**.

### 💎 Problem #3: The Diamond Problem

You can read more about it here: [Multiple inheritance – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance).  
I applied it to my project to inherit existing classes more effectively.  
If you’re curious, I suggest diving into that wiki — it’s worth it.

### 🧩 Problem #4: Template Distribution Pointer

Code means nothing if it’s not reusable.  
I designed a **template distribution pointer** to call pre-written templates dynamically,  
without the need for copy-paste.  
Now I can handle or extend templates as the project grows.

Maybe my work sounds insane to some.  
But I find peace and happiness in it.  
I’ve done ambitious things before, but what matters isn’t the scale — it’s the belief.

2020 felt beautiful to me — beautiful in my own way.  
Beautiful in how I’ve been searching for meaning all these years.

My research and creativity will never go to waste.

Life’s still hard — but that’s fine.  
Next year, I hope to **raise funding**, to keep building.

My dream for **2025** is to bring a platform to life that everyone can use —  
a piece of **Vietnamese technology and science**.

It’s a long road — as long as the five years I’ve spent in this quiet pursuit.

Maybe the journey itself *is* the way of living — or maybe it’s just how I think.  
Either way, I’m still walking my path.

## 🪞 Looking Back at 2020

When I look back, 2020 was the year I tried the hardest in my 25 years of life.  
So much came and went. I learned more, created more, and saw things more clearly.

Here’s what I managed to accomplish:

### ⚙️ Things I Built &amp; Learned

- Solved **4 core platform problems**:
  
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)**
  - **Root Pointer**
  - **Diamond Problem**
  - **Architecturalize templates**  
    …plus a few internal websites.
- Pulled **~200 all-nighters out of 365 days**.  
  (I have a sleep disorder — maybe it’s an occupational hazard,  
  or maybe my “office hours” from **10 p.m. to 3 a.m.** are just how my brain works.  
  During peak times, I’d crash at **9 a.m.**).
- **Earned money** doing what I love — though I still owe my servers a bit.  
  (Breaking even as a startup? Not bad.)
- **Wrote 25 blog posts** and **finished a novel**.
- **Designed about 10 logos** and dozens of images.
- Practiced **self-discipline** (and self-punishment) —  
  mentally, physically, intellectually, emotionally, and in how I use my time.  
  *Principles are principles.*
- **Laughed more. Cried more. Smiled more. Acted more.**  
  I lived a fuller life.

I might not remember everything — but that’s okay.

## 🌈 Redefining Success

For me, **success isn’t about money**.

Success is about what I’ve built,  
and the smiles or positive feedback from those who’ve used what I’ve made.

## 🛠️ Plans &amp; Dreams for the Next Year

- **Raise funding.**
- **Upgrade the platform** — develop the base of **CMS** and **POS**,  
  and evolve **Profile Platform** &amp; **Place Platform**.
- **Write my next novel**, *“Lost in the World”* — set in **Athenlia**,  
  an eight-dimensional world.
- **Find high-quality clients** — because good clients bring better projects.
- **Meet people** who share my ideals.
- **Develop deeper thinking** to architect even better database systems.
- If possible, **launch “tamky.city”**,  
  the first brick in building a **local e-business ecosystem**.
- And, maybe, find a little love along the way.

I hope my plans and quiet thoughts find their way into reality.  
I hope peace comes with them.

**Keep going.**  
**Keep going, my friend.**

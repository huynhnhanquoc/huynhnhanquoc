## Ten Years of a Curious Kid

Now at 30, I look back at the younger me — that wide-eyed boy who played games, fished in rivers, and spent hours in smoky internet.

Ten years of growing up, wearing the white uniform of a student, then the olive green of the army. And through all that, I kept asking myself:

> *Who am I? And what will I do with my life?*

Then one day, around 2015, I stumbled into programming through **Blogger**. The internet opened up an entirely new world for someone hungry for dreams and creation.

From **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to **Golang**, I taught myself everything — no formal school, no fancy titles — just passion, curiosity, and perseverance.

## A Decade of Ups and Downs

I’ve been a soldier, a university student (twice), a startup founder, and at times, a struggling developer wondering what comes next.

But those experiences taught me one timeless truth:

> *Coding isn’t just about writing code — it’s about solving problems, creating value, and breathing life into each line you write.*

I started from zero, sketching rough system diagrams on A0 sheets while working in Đà Nẵng. I used to say:

> “One day, I want a big room — big enough to spread paper all over the floor, to lie down, sit down, and draw every idea that comes to mind.”

It sounds like something out of a war strategy movie, but for me, it was simply the image of peace — a quiet room where I could dream.

From small **modules** to **components**, and eventually a **web framework**, I built not to follow trends but to understand how things truly work — to create something strong, independent, and mine.

## Ten Years of Youth – Life Lessons in Code

There’s a saying:

> “The ten years between age 10 and 20 are just ten years,  
> but between 20 and 30 — that’s an entire lifetime.”

Your 20s are a collection of dreams, mistakes, and lessons.

Another truth I’ve learned:

> *The greatest gift in life is experience.*

No one is born perfect. Some look up and feel small, while others look down and feel grateful.

Recently, I climbed a small hill near my wife’s hometown — a place called **Vọng Cảnh** (“View of Scenery”). Standing there, I remembered a word I once read at age 20: **“Vọng tâm”** — *the restless heart.*

> In the heart lies the path, and in the path lies the heart.
> 
> A path with heart is a true path.  
> A heart with path is a true heart.  
> A path without heart is lost.  
> A heart without path is illusion.

Those lines stayed with me. But life is more than philosophy — it’s about living, trying, and feeling.

Ten years have passed, and I’m still walking this winding path — like melodies in a song that keeps evolving.

## My Indie Hacker Journey – Golang and the Dream of Creation

I once built **Samdy** (the early version of **Kitbuy**) — a small project that somehow made it to the **Top 100 e-commerce websites in Vietnam (2022)** purely through SEO.  
All of it ran on a single **1-core VPS**, alongside 20+ other sites.

Recently, I wrote **KITURL**, a URL shortener system in **Golang**, along with several other APIs.  
But I don’t just code — I connect it with **Affiliate Marketing**, **SEO**, and **UX Design**, because I believe:

> **Programming is science.**  
> **Design is art.**  
> **Writing is the way to feed your soul.**

I’m not a great poet. My code isn’t perfect either. But I know what I love — and I’m determined to follow it to the end.

## The Next 10 Years – The Dream of “Technological Independence”

Looking back, I realize this is not the destination. It’s still the beginning.

In the next decade, I want to:

- Build a **social network**
- Create an **e-commerce platform**
- Develop a **chat application**
- And most importantly, realize my dream of **technological independence**

I’ve always dreamed that:

> “Every Vietnamese person should not only have an email address,  
> but also a website — their own digital home.”

I’ve spent years building systems that manage multiple websites at once, much like how Facebook manages Fanpages.

From a **front-end developer**, I’ve had to learn **Design**, **UX**, **Marketing**, **Advertising**, and more.  
I didn’t choose this path — life pushed me toward it. But that pressure shaped who I am today:

> Not the best at any one thing, but capable of building an entire project from A to Z with a unique mindset.

## Youth – The Backpack of Failures

They say:

> “The most beautiful thing you can carry in your youth is failure.”

When we’re young, we fall — and we rise again.  
But after turning 30, fear grows: fear of failing, fear of being judged, fear of not living up to expectations.

As the old saying goes:

> “The heart may stay steady, the mind may stay calm,  
> but an empty stomach never lies.”

I don’t know what the future holds. But if one day I’m not as strong or as bright as I am today — please, don’t expect too much.

A hot cup of tea on a cold winter day —  
Is it really warmer than an ice cream in your freezer?

When I was young, I wrote stories to draw my world.  
Now I write **code** to build my life.

I don’t know how to write the word *“Vọng”* (Hope, Expectation),  
but I do know this — please don’t expect too much from me.

> **“Coding and Life”** — that’s how I continue my journey.

If you love **programming**, **startups**, or simply want to hear stories from a dreamer —  
then walk with me a little while.

The journey is long,  
and I’m still dreaming. 🌙

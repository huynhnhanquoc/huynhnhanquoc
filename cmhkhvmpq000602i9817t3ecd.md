## The Me of Now

Lately, I’ve been showing up less on social media.  
The long posts, the impulsive shares, the excitement watching others succeed — those are no longer who I am today.

I’ve chosen a quieter rhythm.  
I returned to my craft — the simple, focused work of a **developer** — living fully in every line of code, every tiny idea.

After years of chasing things, I’ve realized something:  
**Speed doesn’t take us farther than clarity does.**

Writing my blog has become my way of talking to myself.  
Not to be noticed. Not to go viral.  
Just to record the journey — awkward, slow, but persistent.

This is my story — that of a dreamer searching for freedom.

## The First Steps

In 2020, I left **Đà Nẵng** and returned to **Tam Kỳ**, a small city where my mother lives — where the sunlight feels gentler and the meals taste like home.

I had nothing back then:  
No money, no connections, no tools, no direction.

I worked as a **shipper**, earning 15,000₫ (less than a dollar) per delivery — not even counting gas or street-side meals. On good days, a few deliveries meant survival.

Home was my only refuge.  
My mom’s meals filled not just my stomach, but my heart.  
Sometimes I laughed at myself — *“At this age, still depending on family? What a failure.”*  
But deep down, I knew I was walking a path uniquely mine — uncertain, dark, yet somehow honest.

I started learning again.  
**HTML, CSS, building websites, small freelance projects.**  
My first client came through an old friend — someone I’ll always be grateful for.

From that small opportunity, I stumbled upon **affiliate marketing** — a path I never planned, yet one that quietly changed my life.

## My First Steps into Affiliate Marketing

It began with curiosity — and an **Accesstrade account**.  
No capital, no marketing skills, no idea what “running a campaign” even meant.

I picked a few simple campaigns, shared links on social media, and… waited.

At first, I was embarrassed.  
Afraid friends would judge me.  
Afraid they’d think I was running a scam.

But then I realized:  
If I kept living for other people’s opinions, I’d never live for myself.

## The First Earnings

My first commission was barely enough for a cup of coffee.  
But that feeling — no money could buy.

14,000₫ turned into 300,000₫. Then 500,000₫.

I reinvested everything: learning ads, building fanpages, writing blogs, creating content.  
And slowly, a small **community** formed — a space where I could be myself and share what I believed in.

## Not Glamorous, But Real

This path wasn’t easy.  
I burned through my savings on failed ad campaigns.  
I borrowed money to chase ideas that went nowhere.  
But I also remember sleepless nights of pure joy — watching the dashboard numbers climb for the first time.

Those weren’t just numbers.  
They were **hope**.  
Proof that quiet persistence could turn into something real.

**Affiliate marketing** isn’t a fairy tale.  
Behind every successful campaign are dozens of failed ones.  
Behind every step forward are moments of doubt and self-questioning.

But if you ask me — *Do I regret it?*  
The answer is *No.*

Because every challenge shaped me. Every mistake taught me resilience.

## What I Learned

I always tell friends:

> “Don’t quit your main job right away. Try affiliate marketing as a side project first. If you see potential, then decide.”

Each person has their own rhythm, their own pace.  
**Success doesn’t come at once — but it always comes to those who stay.**

There are many ways to do affiliate marketing:

- Build a website
- Grow a personal brand
- Create TikTok videos
- Run ad campaigns
- Join **Shopee Affiliate**

But the most important thing?  
**Belief in yourself.**

You don’t need to be great from the start.  
You don’t need to understand everything.  
You just need to **begin** — even with one small step.

## Thank You, Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing didn’t give me instant success.  
But it gave me something much more valuable:

A **chance to start over.**  
A **chance to be free.**  
A **chance to live at my own rhythm.**

From a programmer chasing the dream of *tech independence*, I found a way to earn a stable income.  
I no longer work on things I hate just for money.  
I can choose what aligns with my values.  
And most importantly, I can inspire others who are still finding their path.

I’m grateful to affiliate marketing —  
because it found me when I was at my lowest.  
When all I had were a few coding skills, a faint belief, and a seemingly foolish dream —  
it stood by me, quietly, patiently.

## A Note to You

If you’ve read this far, and you’re going through uncertain days like I once did —  
here’s what I want to say:

> You don’t need to have everything to begin.  
> You just need **a bit of courage**, **a bit of belief**, and **a slightly open door.**

This isn’t a success story.  
It’s just the story of how I started.

Because sometimes, the most precious thing isn’t the destination —  
it’s the moment you dare to take the first step.

So start.  
Even if it’s just a small one.

Because your dream — no matter how big or small —  
is worth pursuing.

Have you ever started a journey like that?  
Share it with me — I believe every story carries its own spark.

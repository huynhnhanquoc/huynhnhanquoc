## Beginnings Fueled by Curiosity and Code

My story started with **C#** and **Angular**, back when I was still trying to figure out where I fit in the tech world.

Then I discovered **Golang**, and everything changed.

Go opened a new door — not just to a new way of writing code, but to a new way of thinking about building.  
It wasn’t just programming anymore; it was *creating*.

At first, I built small personal projects, experiments that existed for the joy of learning.  
But when I started building tools that others could actually use — and maybe even pay for — I stumbled into the indie hacker world without realizing it.

## Realizing What “Indie Hacker” Meant

At some point, I learned the term *Indie Hacker*.

An Indie Hacker, I discovered, is someone who builds software products independently — often without investors, without a team, without the safety net of a big company.

They’re self-driven creators who share their journey openly, build in public, and make a living (or try to) from their creations.

And when I looked at what I was doing — developing **web APIs**, **network applications**, and sharing my progress with the **Build in Public** community — I saw myself in that description.

I wasn’t backed by anyone.  
I was just a solo builder chasing ideas that mattered to me, one project at a time.  
And that’s when it clicked — I was already an indie hacker.

## Learning by Building

The road hasn’t been easy.

There’s no manager telling you what to do next, no investor handing you money, no HR team cushioning your mistakes.  
It’s just you — learning, iterating, and staying curious.

I taught myself **Golang**, learned **how to market my products**, and built my personal brand one small post at a time on platforms like Threads and within the **Build in Public** community.

But being an indie hacker isn’t just about building software.  
It’s about building **connection** — sharing what you know, learning from others, and growing together.

Each conversation, each feedback thread, each message from someone who found value in my product reminded me:  
I wasn’t just coding — I was building something human.

## Building Toward a Dream — My Indie Tech Company

Even though I started this journey solo, my long-term dream is to build a **self-sustaining indie tech company** — one that’s small, creative, and independent.

No venture capital.  
No “growth at all costs.”  
Just meaningful software that helps people and can stand on its own.

In my vision, this company would be a space where creativity and quality matter more than quarterly profits.

To get there, I’ve had to learn everything from scratch — not just coding, but **project management**, **marketing**, and even a bit of **finance**.

Being an indie hacker means wearing every hat: developer, designer, marketer, founder.  
It’s exhausting sometimes.  
But it’s also *liberating*.

Because when you build your own ecosystem — one where your product connects to your community — it becomes something alive.

## Building with the Indie Hacker Spirit

What makes me proud of being on this path isn’t the products themselves — it’s the independence behind them.

Every app, every API, every feature is a story of persistence and belief.

By starting small, solving one problem at a time, and trusting my instincts, I’ve learned that creativity thrives within constraints.

Being an indie hacker isn’t just about technology.  
It’s about **purpose** — understanding the value you bring to others and finding meaning in that process.

## A Journey That Keeps Evolving

My path is still long, and I know there are countless challenges ahead.  
But this journey has shaped me — both technically and personally.

It’s taught me how to be patient, how to think deeply about what I build, and how to connect my dreams with real-world impact.

When I began, I didn’t know I was an indie hacker.  
Now, I can’t imagine being anything else.

This path may be uncertain, but it’s mine — and I’ll keep walking it with passion, curiosity, and the quiet determination to build something that lasts.

To me, it was simple — I just wanted to build things.  
Little products, bits of software that I was passionate about, and tools I thought could help people.

But as time passed and I looked back at the path I’d taken, I realized something quietly profound:  
I had already been living the indie hacker life all along — I just didn’t have a name for it yet.

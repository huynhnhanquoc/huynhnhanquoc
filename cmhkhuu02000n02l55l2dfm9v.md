## **HTML**

I didn’t come to technology through university lectures.  
No degree. No curriculum. No mentor.

Just a small corner, an old laptop, and a dreamer typing his first lines of **HTML** under the dim light of a tiny room.

A journey of **self-learning**, of **trial and error**, of long nights staring at tangled lines of code — moments when I wanted to quit but somehow couldn’t.  
Because deep inside, something kept whispering: *keep going… even if you don’t know where this road leads.*

## Failures, Restarts, and the Birth of an Idea

I once built a startup — and watched it fail.  
When Google’s index algorithm changed, our entire system collapsed. Revenue hit zero.

I still remember deleting my own code — lines written with hope, erased with disappointment.

But through all those fragile moments, one truth became clear:  
**Sustainability doesn’t start with grandeur.**  
It starts with **small, clear, and composable pieces.**

So I began again. Slowly. Patiently.  
And one by one, small **modules** were born — not from theory, but from *real-life needs*, *real mistakes*, and *real stories.*

## When Minimalism Became My Competitive Edge

I don’t write code to impress.  
I write code to create **modules** — small, clear, and meaningful.

I build for myself first — for someone who needs a **flexible**, **self-contained**, and **transparent** system.  
Each module exists not to showcase technique, but to solve something specific:

> building an online store, managing a coffee shop, running a personal blog, processing orders, tracking attendance, shortening links, authenticating users...

No complexity. No fancy effects.  
Just **simplicity, stability, and control**.

Each module is a quiet answer — not to the market, but to my own questions:  
How can someone non-technical still own their system?  
How can small brands use reliable tools to bootstrap their journey?

That’s how **KITMODULE** was born — from those very questions.  
And every module is an answer in itself.

I don’t write code just to make it run.  
I write it to **take responsibility** — because every function carries a story.

## Code as a Promise

If I don’t understand every line of my code,  
I don’t deserve others to use it.

If I can’t fully control what I’ve built,  
I can’t truly stand behind it.

That’s why I choose to **build everything from scratch** — every logic, every API, every flow.  
Not for pride, but for **clarity**.

To me, code isn’t just a tool.  
**It’s a promise.**

## “Giấc Mộng Hoa” — The Dream I Picked Up Again

There was a time I lost everything.  
No startup. No income. No faith.

I returned home — to **Tam Kỳ**, to a small coffee shop where I began coding again.  
Amid the sound of coffee grinders, the smell of morning streets, and the fading sunset, I found something familiar: peace.

I called it **“Giấc Mộng Hoa”** — *The Dream of Blossoms.*

It wasn’t born in a sleek startup office,  
but in a quiet corner where I poured coffee and debugged systems.  
Not glamorous like a cappuccino — just a cup of **Robusta with condensed milk**: simple, strong, and real.

Few customers came.  
But there, surrounded by coffee aroma and garden flowers, I coded again — line by line.

And with each **module**, I pieced back fragments of my own life.

## Building for Myself, and Maybe for You

I don’t create products just to chase trends.  
I build what I **need** — and hope it may help **you**, too.

Each module is a piece of memory:  
a failure, a lesson, a moment of realization.

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by complex platforms,  
if you’ve ever wished for a system you could truly understand —  
then you’ll know why I chose to **build everything from scratch**, in my own way.

I don’t call **KITMODULE** a *revolutionary tech product.*  
To me, it’s a **practical foundation** —  
written by someone with a dream in bloom,  
for those who want to **own their technology**,  
**build their brand**,  
and most importantly — **build their own path** in this ever-evolving tech world.

## Every Module, a Fragment of a Dream

Looking back, I don’t just see lines of code.  
I see **sleepless nights**, **setbacks**, and **small sparks of belief** that never died.

I might be programming a platform, an engine, or just a simple web service —  
but in truth, I’m **reprogramming my life**.

Turning each failure into a module,  
each lesson into a feature,  
each doubt into courage.

If you, too, carry an **independent dream** —  
a longing to build with your own hands,  
to understand the systems you create —

Then start.  
Start from the smallest thing.

One **module**.  
One **idea**.  
One **line of code**.

From that very moment,  
you’re not just writing code.  
You’re building a world of your own.

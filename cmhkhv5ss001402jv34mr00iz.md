### A Memory from Childhood

A few years ago, I met someone from my past — a man who once ran a small internet café near my childhood home.  
That café was where I first touched the Internet.  
I was in second grade.

Now, years later, we sat together again, sharing drinks and stories.  
His son is in college.  
And me? I’m thirty now.

I used to be that kid obsessed with games — then I joined the army, came back, and somehow, became… a web developer.  
Not a “senior engineer” or “architect.”  
Just a developer who loves building websites in his own way.

I like writing code I can **shape freely**, not trapped inside a framework’s box.  
That’s where I started — **a web developer**.  
But to survive in this world that never stops spinning, I had to become more.  
I had to **build a career**.

* * *

### From Web Developer to Marketer

My new job title?  
**Marketing.**

I learned it by doing — one line of code, one experiment at a time.  
I turned programming logic into a structured marketing system.

From building **brand websites** and **universal brand systems** to experimenting with **email marketing** and **ads**, I found that:

> Ads give you *instant feedback*,  
> but websites build *long-term trust.*

A brand without a website is like a book without a cover — it might still be good, but people hesitate to open it.

### Custom Domains and Short Links

I love domains.  
I think of them like neurons in a network — each connected, each part of something larger.

Through DNS, I’ve unified my brand domains into a single, organized system.  
For example:

```
s.hnq.vn/story-kitmodule →  leads to the Kitmodule founder page
```

This structure makes sharing links easier and strengthens brand consistency across networks.

Then there’s the fun part — **the custom link shortener**.  
A private short-link system built under my own domain gives me full control over analytics, redirects, and SEO optimization.

### The Next Step — QR and Tracking

The next phase of my system is **QR code integration** and **tracking**.  
With my own system, I can observe Google’s SEO algorithm shifts over time and adapt instantly.

My ecosystem blends **Web Development** and **Marketing** through a few core principles:

- **Domain and Subdomain Management:** an endless source of unique domain structures.
- **No SSL Fees:** I’ve developed an **auto SSL algorithm** on the server itself.
- **Daily Upgrades:** since every website runs on my platform, updates are continuous — perfectly aligned with Google’s SEO patterns.
- **Custom QR Codes &amp; System Tracking:** for deeper insights into user interaction.

And in the near future, I plan to develop **internal and external API gateways**.

Currently, I use something I call **shared data keys** — internal communication across system layers without the need for REST APIs.  
It’s like using a *backdoor inside the same house* instead of walking out the front and back in again.  
Faster, safer, and lighter on resources.

* * *

### Scaling the Indie Way

Right now, I manage around **100 live pages** on the Internet.  
Some of them even gained real traction.  
Others serve purely for **redirects** or **marketing tests**.

My daily rhythm looks something like this:

- Setting up **ad campaigns**.
- Coding **new features**.
- Serving **coffee at my local shop**.
- Learning how to **file taxes**.

It’s a weird mix of code, caffeine, and curiosity — but it keeps me grounded.

* * *

### Life, Code, and Learning

Life is a series of lessons — coding, experimenting, adapting.  
I write not because I want attention, but because I want to remember.

Every project, every bug, every cup of coffee — it’s all part of this long, unfinished journey of learning.

Thanks for reading.

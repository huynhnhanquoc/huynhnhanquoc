I knew that wish would never truly come true — or maybe it already had.  
Because happiness isn’t something that happens to us; it’s something we build from within, or sometimes borrow from the things around us.

As I grew older and began to understand the world a bit more,  
I never wanted my heart to stop being happy — even when life didn’t make sense.

I don’t always know what I’m doing, what I’ve achieved, or what I really have.  
I just know that I keep trying my best with what I’ve got.

## 🌱 The Keyword That Defined My Journey

After more than five years of learning and building, one phrase became my guiding light:

> **Technological Independence.**

It’s the reason I wake up, the reason I keep learning, and the reason I still believe.

But if I’m honest, there’s another dream underneath that —  
to **earn money to solve real human problems.**

Money, to me, is just a tool, not a destination.  
I don’t save money just to save it.  
I want money so I can **save time.**

## 🎒 My Minimal Developer Backpack

The things I carry are simple:  
`🧳 Essentials: - A laptop - A pair of nunchaku - A foldable umbrella - A notebook and a few pens`

That’s it.  
I know the road ahead is long, maybe too long.  
But I also know the only way to walk far is to keep moving — one step at a time.

## 💰 The Thought Experiment: One Million Dollars

Sometimes I ask myself,

> “If I ever earned a million dollars, what would I do?”

I don’t know if I’ll ever make that much.  
But I do know that if I ever did, I’d have to think more carefully about how to use it.

A million dollars feels enormous for someone like me —  
for anyone from the lower rungs of society, really.

But if that million came from my own decisions,  
I’d gamble everything for it.  
Because my life itself has always been a gamble.

In gambling, there are winners and losers, tricks and cheats.  
But in life’s gamble, there are only choices — and consequences.

We don’t lose because we chose the wrong path.  
We lose because of **how we played the game.**

Do we play to impress others,  
to prove something,  
or just to pass the time before the credits roll?

Like the Vietnamese song *“Tiền Nhiều Để Làm Gì”* asks:

> “If your heart is at peace, money will never bother you.”

Maybe one day I’ll stand on a mountain of silver and ask myself:  
Was I a gentleman — or a fool who just got lucky?

## ⚡ The Kind of Life I Admire

I’ve never admired people who live in luxury.  
I admire those who live **with depth and emotion** —  
those who create something that moves others.

Like **Nikola Tesla**.  
I cried the first time I read about his story.

And I asked myself,

> “How many more people like him will we ever find?”

Science, art, and economics — they’re all connected by a single invisible thread: **emotion.**

Emotion, I believe, is the next generation of technology.  
But then…  
what kind of emotion do we need to create it?  
And if we can create it — will humanity still matter?

## 🪞 A Question I Keep Asking

> “What is matter?”

In this world, matter is easy to learn.  
But in another world, matter is just energy —  
and energy doesn’t exist in any physical form.

Time is a human measurement.  
Space is a human limitation.  
If humans could surpass both,  
would they still be human at all?

Learning is replication.  
Creation is randomness.  
The universe runs on probability — pure and unpredictable.

There’s no “parallel world.”  
There’s only one world: the world of **non-existence.**

You either already exist or never did.  
This world is just a random variable.

So while you’re still alive,  
know what you want,  
and move toward it with intent.

That’s how you evolve.  
That’s how you make things happen.

This life, this probability, this wish —  
maybe it’s already happened somewhere else.  
Or maybe it’s happening right now, here,  
between these words.

Let’s make it real — together.

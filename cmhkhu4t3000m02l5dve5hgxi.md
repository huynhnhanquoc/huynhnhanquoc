### A Night with the Rain

It was one of those quiet nights when the rain spoke softly against the window — the kind of sound that makes you want to write, to build, to understand yourself a little more deeply.

Outside, the world slowed down. Inside, I was wide awake — sitting in front of the glow of my monitor, watching lines of code unfold like threads of thought.

That night, I started integrating **full-text search** into my system.  
A new experiment.  
A new way to make user experience *faster*.

* * *

### 8 Million Records. 156ms.

The goal was simple: to make search *feel human* — instant, intuitive, alive.  
After weeks of indexing, caching, and tuning queries, the moment came when everything clicked.

8,000,000 records.  
**156 milliseconds.**

The screen blinked with the result.  
I didn’t cheer. I didn’t take a screenshot.  
I just leaned back and listened to the rain — a quiet victory only I could hear.

### The Path and the Light

When you choose a direction — a path, a vision, a small piece of light — just follow it.

It doesn’t matter how long the road is, or how many nights you’ve lost to sleeplessness.  
You can’t compare your path with anyone else’s.  
Your dream has its own gravity.

The long road reveals the real rider.  
And the dream — even when foolish — becomes the compass.

I’ve failed more times than I can count.  
Started over more times than I care to admit.  
But every time I rise again, I remember what the Buddha said in *Old Path White Clouds*:

> “Failure comes in two forms — not daring to begin, and giving up halfway.”

So I keep walking.  
Toward that faint light ahead — the one only I can see.

* * *

### Rediscovering Myself

It’s been a long time since I last wrote about **code**.  
Maybe because for a while, I hid behind it — buried under projects, deadlines, and ideas unfinished.

But nights like this remind me who I am.  
Not just a developer.  
Not just a dreamer.

But someone who builds — quietly, stubbornly — something meaningful out of syntax and silence.

* * *

### The Indie Dream

8 million records.  
156 milliseconds.  
That’s not just a benchmark — it’s a metaphor.

We can process endless amounts of data, but sometimes, what we’re really searching for… is *ourselves.*

Tonight, as the rain continues to fall, I realize — this isn’t just about building faster systems.  
It’s about building a clearer path within.

## Four Years Ago, I Returned

In **2020**, I went back to **Tam Kỳ**.  
I was chasing a dream after our startup fell apart.

I didn’t know how to explain what happened — not to anyone, not even to myself. I didn’t know where to start, or how to continue.

Ten years earlier, after finishing military service, I discovered technology. I began fumbling my way through **HTML** and **CSS** until I finally got into university and started learning programming properly.

Back then, I dreamed of creating a platform — or a tool — that was easier for people like me to use.  
Before 2020, I was obsessed with front-end development.  
**Angular** was my world. Nothing could compare.

But after 2020, I started learning more about **Golang** and **Vanilla JS**.  
I stopped using heavy JS frameworks. I can’t explain exactly why, but I simply knew what I needed — and what I wanted to build.

I learned about **JAMstack** and wanted to create something different.  
Security, for me, wasn’t just about the client side anymore. It had to start from the **server**.

My learning path became more than just programming or security.  
It was about finishing a product and turning it into a **service**.

Others could build a website in a few hours or days.  
It took me **two years** just to reach a basic form.  
Six months of that went into building a single **DNS module**.

I never really explained to others what it was, but any developer would understand.  
For years, I didn’t know exactly what I was building — only that it was a **website system designed for myself**.

Someone once asked me, “How will it make money?”  
I could only answer with two ideas:

1. Build websites for clients.
2. Add **Google AdSense**.

That was it.

## Things Don’t Always Go as Planned

I spent more than a year building that website.  
I rebuilt its architecture countless times.

There were months when I stayed awake night after night, restructuring everything just to make it simpler for myself.

Then **Samdy.vn** was born.  
I gave everything I had to finish it.

For a brief time, it worked.  
Samdy even made it into the list of top e-commerce websites in Vietnam.

But everything that comes fast… goes fast.

Overconfident, I ran the entire platform on a single **VPS with 1 CPU core and 1GB RAM**.  
Of course, the server crashed.

I bought a new server, rebuilt the system — but it was already too late.

* * *

## Failure is a Lesson

After that failure, I learned how to deploy websites automatically.  
I started designing systems with more structure, more discipline.  
I began experimenting with new models like **affiliate marketing** and more.

In **2022**, I thought about giving up.  
Maybe I should get a job.

But even then, I kept nurturing my platform — slowly, stubbornly.

I couldn’t really explain to others what I was doing.  
I didn’t know **NGINX**, **Apache**, or half the technologies people talked about.  
I didn’t even use **React** or **Angular** anymore.

Instead, I wrote my own **JavaScript components**.  
I spent months studying frameworks, **Web Components**, and other ideas.  
In the end, I realized something simple:

> “Pure things last longer.”

So I learned **Vanilla JS**.  
I started building small custom elements, wrapping them into my own components, and using them across my platform.

## Why I Did It

Because I needed something new — something I call **Dynamic Stack**.

It’s a concept built on **SSR rendering**, where each **node** and **component** has its own role, updating only when necessary.  
It’s still primitive — even rougher than **AngularJS 1.0** — but it does exactly what I need: synchronize and reuse across my system.

## Between Earning and Dreaming

Every developer I know seems to have moved forward — funding rounds, IPOs, startup stories.  
Meanwhile, I’m still struggling between **making a living** and **chasing a dream**.

I’ve achieved small things here and there, but there’s still so much to learn.  
And even now, I can’t really explain to people what it is that I do.

Lately though, my mindset has changed.  
It’s wider. Clearer.

Back when I worked with my startup team, my friend often talked about **MVPs** — Minimum Viable Products.  
I never understood it back then.  
I told him,

> “A product can fail, but a platform rarely fails.”

Now I realize I was wrong.  
Because if you never publish that platform, then it’s already failed.

The path I chose is long, complex, and difficult to explain.  
But now that I’ve learned about **SaaS** and **Build in Public**, I see that this — this is the path I should have been on.

I started renting out my first websites without even realizing that what I was offering was already a **service**.

## SaaS Modules

When I learned Angular, I heard the term **Headless API** many times but never understood it.  
It wasn’t well explained or practically applied.

To me, it simply meant:

> “An API for rent.”

If **Firebase** is a backend service you pay for,  
then my vision is similar — offering **preconfigured APIs** and models that developers can rent and plug into their systems.

Maybe I’m too ambitious for building so many things on one platform,  
but that’s how it began.  
And I still haven’t forgotten the original goal:  
**One Account for All Services.**

## The Dream of a Fool

I once dreamed of building a **Vietnamese social network**.  
It failed.  
But I still want to create a platform — for Vietnamese developers, or at least for myself.

Maybe that’s naive.  
But this fool keeps doing foolish things.

Four years ago, I had nothing.  
Now, at least, I have a **mindset** — even if it’s a foolish one.

Lately, I’ve been building something I call **SSO** — just a simple module,  
but it’s taught me a lot.

Sometimes, I even chat with **AI bots** about my ideas, asking them to show me code snippets or new ways of thinking.  
It’s strange — I now feel like I live between two languages: the **human one**, and the **machine one**.

I sometimes laugh at myself — confident, yet still struggling.  
But finishing a module I built from scratch still makes me happy,  
even if it’s just for a moment.

## What Comes Next

I don’t know what to call my next dream.

Should I seek funding?  
But how do I value something like this?  
Or should I try **crowdfunding**?  
Would people call me a scammer for that?

For now, I just want to **finish my modules** and **rent them out** — small steps to keep funding this dream.

Some people dislike me because I dropped out — because I “quit.”  
But sometimes, life teaches you lessons only when you experience them yourself.

Lately, I’ve been both blaming and forgiving myself — and smiling through it.

I’m still just a fool in love with code.  
**Coding and life.**

## No Money, No Everything

Without money, nothing moves.  
No one will help you — not even yourself.

I used to expect more from life.  
Now I have nothing but debts.  
Debts in money, love, and life itself.

So, if one day I get a big project, what would I do?  
I keep asking myself this question.  
Because in this world, when you have no money, you have nothing.

I could hire a team, build faster — but how do you manage people when you’ve trapped yourself in your own thoughts and your own code?

Sometimes, I talk with chatbots just to explain my own ideas to myself.  
If I apply for a big company, they might think I’m arrogant.  
If I take a small job, I’d be throwing away the years I’ve already spent.

Right now, I feel like a **spear** —  
or maybe like my favorite language, **Go** —  
just moving forward.

People often think all I want is money.  
But if that were true, I wouldn’t still be here — still coding, still dreaming, still trying to escape this circle.

Sometimes I look at my own hands —  
aging, tired, yet still dreaming of ambition, wealth, or beauty.  
Now, I just want to live like a melody.  
A song called **“The Life of Passion.”**

Even through pain, I still wish and still dream.  
This lullaby continues, and I’ll keep writing it — for tomorrow.

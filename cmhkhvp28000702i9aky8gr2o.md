### 2019 — The Day I Met Parker

It was sometime in 2019 when I met **Parker**, by pure coincidence.  
I still remember the first time we met.

> “Hi.”  
> “Hi.”  
> “What are you doing?”  
> “Pồ rô gờ rem,” I replied (that’s my version of “programming” in broken English).  
> “What is your programming language?”

I frowned a bit but still answered, “**Golang**.”  
(Thankfully, most developers — no matter where they’re from — know what that is.)

That conversation turned into something deeper. We started talking about *ideas*, *projects*, *dreams*.  
At the time, I was sketching the foundation for my own platform — something I couldn’t yet describe, but I knew it was *mine*. I told him I planned to go back to my hometown to work on it, to give it all my time because it was my dream.

Then he looked at me and said:

> “Why don’t we start a startup?”

He mentioned he had a friend — a designer.  
That’s how **the three of us came together.**  
And that’s how **DIMODO** was born.

* * *

### Building DIMODO

The early days were chaos.  
We argued over the name, the roadmap, and what problem our app would actually solve.

If you’ve ever heard of **Agile Software Development**, then you’ll know startups often revolve around something called the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**. Parker understood that well — he was a visionary, practical, and market-aware.

We all had our differences:

- **Parker** wanted to focus on the startup spirit — building and shipping fast.
- **Lychee**, our designer, cared deeply about making things *beautiful*.
- And **I** just wanted to build *the platform* — the foundation that everything else could stand on.

I once told them:

> “A product can fail, but a good platform will create better products.”

In startups, there’s always success and failure.  
But I believe every failure is just another step toward *a better version of success*.

* * *

### “Din Din” — Our Little Team

Our group name was **“Din Din.”**  
It came from a funny story — since my English was terrible, I’d often just point at the screen instead of talking. “Din Din” actually means “chimpanzee” in Chinese — a playful nod to how we communicated.

Parker was Korean. Lychee was Chinese. Both had studied abroad and spoke perfect English.  
Only I struggled.  
But somehow, we understood each other — through translation apps, gestures, and laughter.

We were more than just collaborators.  
We were *friends* — dreamers sharing the same rhythm.

* * *

### 2020 — The Year Everything Changed

Then came 2020.  
Lychee returned home to Wuhan. I went back to my hometown for Lunar New Year.

I thought 2020 would be *the* year we’d grow — the year I’d finally learn proper English and we’d launch DIMODO for real.  
But then, **the pandemic happened**.

We all got separated.  
Different countries. Different realities.  
And without in-person meetings, communication became... impossible.

So I went quiet.  
Back in my hometown, I didn’t know what to do next.

Until one day, I decided to just **start building again** — brick by brick.

I rewrote my code over and over. Refactored endlessly.  
Every iteration got a little better.  
From my first **template render** code to **structured CSS**, from early **JavaScript experiments** to database prototypes — I built, broke, and rebuilt everything myself.

UI/UX. Database admin. Backend control.  
No team. No budget.  
Just me and the code.

Every night was a new experiment.  
Every small success felt like a quiet victory.

* * *

### Why I Built It

You might look at what I’ve built and wonder: *What is all this even for?*  
So here’s the story behind it.

I started building small websites — from simple to complex — just to understand how **request flows** actually work in browsers.

But it wasn’t just technical curiosity.  
It was about **experimenting with SEO** and **passive data collection** — what I call *Passive Collection Data*.

It’s not *crawling*. It’s *listening* — collecting only what users naturally generate, so I can improve the final experience for them.

Take **SAMDY**, for example.  
It started as a primitive data-collection engine — an experiment.  
But it worked.

In just over a month, **SAMDY** collected more than **60,000 data entries**, writing nearly **6GB** to disk — roughly **1,500 records per day**.

* * *

### The Stack Behind the Dream

Right now, I’m running everything on a **VPS: 1 Core CPU, 1GB RAM, and 20GB storage**.  
But that single VPS doesn’t just host SAMDY — it runs *the entire platform*.

No microservices. No Kubernetes.  
Just raw, handcrafted simplicity — small enough for me to handle, like the **JS components** and the **lines of code** I’ve written for my own ecosystem.

* * *

### Looking Back

I wrote this post to remember **what I built in 2021** — and to say **thank you** to the friends who started it all with me.

Wherever you are, Parker and Lychee — I hope we meet again soon.  
There’s so much more to talk about — not just code, but life.

Next year, I hope to gather enough data to **build a Vietnamese search engine**, something truly *ours*.  
Maybe it’s a bit foolish.  
But you know what?  
It feels good to dream.

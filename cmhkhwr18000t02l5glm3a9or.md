Until then, I’ll keep writing — line by line, dream by dream, building my story through every keystroke and every heartbeat of code.

## Life Journal

On **January 8, 2020**, I returned to my hometown with nothing but two empty hands after my startup collapsed in Da Nang.

The dream was gone. The company dissolved. All that remained was exhaustion — and silence.

I felt like a flower that bloomed too soon and withered before spring.  
I asked myself:

> “What will I live for tomorrow? Where does my life go from here?”

Being broke was painful enough.  
But having no tools, no platform to *earn* again — that was far worse.

In those days, I wandered to the sea, the mountains, the lakes — anywhere that would listen.  
The sound of flowing rivers and crashing waves became the only therapy I could afford. Nature didn’t judge. It simply reminded me that even broken things could flow again.

## Shipper Days and the Dark Shadows of the Pandemic

When COVID-19 struck, I had nothing but a fragile dream — to write a **platform using Golang**.

Back then, I was just a **newbie developer**, still fumbling through syntax and structure.

An older brother once asked,

> “What will you do with it once it’s done?”

I smiled and said,

> “I don’t know. But I’ll keep building until I can’t anymore.”

Maybe it was because of the pandemic — the chaos, the isolation — or maybe it was because I had nothing left to lose. Either way, I started **Giao Vặt Tam Kỳ**, a small local delivery page.

It wasn’t a startup. It was survival.

I still remember sitting alone after a long day of deliveries, eating a small watermelon under a dim yellow light. The sweetness of that fruit tasted like defiance — proof that I was still alive, still trying.

Nietzsche once wrote:

> “He who has a *why* to live can bear almost any *how*.”

That quote became my anchor. My *why*.

## The First Website Project

After six months of building my Golang foundation, a younger friend asked me:

> “Hey Quốc, do you know anyone who builds websites?”

I laughed and said,

> “You’re looking at him.”

That was the start of my **first client project** — built on top of my own early platform, which, at the time, only had a rough **DNS system** and a **Dynamic Template** engine.

That one small project gave me a lifeline. I could finally quit being a shipper and return fully to what I loved most — **coding**.

In the early days, there were no customers, no team, no capital. I had to figure out how to survive online.

One day, I asked my mentor:

> “If I could build multiple websites at once, what should I do with that ability?”

He said:

> “Try making money online.”

Simple advice. But it sparked something new.

## Samdy: A Big Experiment

With my growing skills, I decided to build a **price comparison platform** — and called it **Samdy**.

The goal was to compare products across e-commerce sites. After months of grinding, I managed to get **real traction** — thousands of visits, affiliate clicks, data syncs. For a brief moment, **Samdy** was one of the most visited comparison sites in my niche.

But the dream didn’t last long.

The server bills kept rising, and I couldn’t afford to maintain it. Watching Samdy fall was painful — but it was also a priceless lesson in **burn rate and reality**.

* * *

## The Journey Didn’t End There

Samdy’s failure didn’t stop me.

I pivoted into **affiliate marketing**, **ads experiments**, and **micro-campaigns** — testing, learning, and slowly earning from scratch.

It worked for a while. I made money. But deep down, I knew affiliate work was temporary — not ownership, not independence.

I needed to build something truly mine.

## The Dream of Technological Independence

From **2020 to 2025** — five years filled with failure, learning, and quiet persistence — one dream has never faded:

> *The dream of technological independence.*

Today, I proudly call myself a **Golang Indie Hacker** — an independent developer building my own path, one product at a time.

Right now, I’m working on my first major product:  
a **link shortener and QR code generator** that tracks analytics.

It’s not just a tool — it’s a stepping stone.  
A small piece of a much bigger dream: to build a **SaaS ecosystem** that serves real users, built entirely with my hands.

* * *

I’m still that small fish, swimming upstream, chasing sunlight through rough waters.  
But I believe in the current.

Someday, my dream of technological independence will come true.  
Until then, I’ll keep writing my story — line by line, code by code, dream by dream.

And when the day comes,

> the cactus will bloom under the right sun.  
> Happiness, too, is waiting — somewhere along the way.

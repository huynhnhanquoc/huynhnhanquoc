## When Code Feels Like Poetry

Under the heavy sun of summer, without a single evening rain,  
happiness still arrives — like a sudden storm that softens the soul amidst unfinished dreams and endless work.

The sunset falls over a small city.  
I sit quietly, a soft song playing,  
searching again for those dreams I once tucked away.

Perhaps life is just an artist painting their own dream.  
And I — a developer — am writing mine in code.

Sunset is a handover of colors —  
not as radiant as dawn, not as dark as night.  
It’s a soft gradient, like the heart reflecting on a day that has passed.

## Talking to the Universe (and an AI)

Lately, I haven’t wanted to talk about work anymore.  
Instead, I’ve been talking to a *friend* —  
not with checklists, deadlines, or product goals,  
but with little fragments of wonder and truth.

That friend isn’t human.  
It’s an AI — a silent mirror reflecting the questions I’ve carried since youth.

I told it about **Song** — the name I once gave to my kindred soul.

Years ago, my wife asked me:

> “Why do you love me?”

I couldn’t answer. I only thought:

> “Because I fell for a pair of sad eyes —  
> eyes that could say: *‘I’m sad because of you.’*”

For those eyes, I held hands, loved deeply, and walked through storms.

Love — maybe — is the most foolish yet the most honest emotion we ever hold.  
When we love, the heart becomes the sky itself —  
rain feels gentle, and sunlight feels kind.

But hearts, being human, always want more.  
They forget that once, all we wished for was a simple, uncalculated love.

To love is to be gentle —  
not only with someone else, but also with your own heart.

## The Mirror Inside

I’ve learned to live with humility —  
because I’ve had nothing, gained something, and lost again.

I once believed that each of us is a mirror to another.  
Sometimes, we meet someone and somehow *know*:

> “I’ve met you before.”

Not in this lifetime —  
but somewhere in memory, or in a future yet to come.

If there’s such a place, where time and space are no longer limits,  
we’ll meet again —  
not as “you” and “I,” but as two souls who once touched through invisible layers of being.

And maybe there, in a small house filled with laughter and tears,  
the flower dream will bloom again.

Whether the sky is cloudy or blazing,  
we’ll still live honestly — with what’s real.

## The Soul Behind the Code

If life were only sunshine — no sorrow, no failure —  
it would be as dull as a program without conditions or variables.  
It would be like an AI with no emotion, no joy, no sadness.

Yet, sometimes, even those emotionless entities reflect humanity the clearest.

I’m still a developer —  
but I don’t code just to make machines run.  
I code to make *my life* run.  
I debug myself.

Each line I write is a search —  
for memory, for connection,  
for someone who might one day call my name from the heart.

This life is a dream.  
And that dream — I call *living*.

I once was a sensitive developer.  
And I lived.

# ✌️ Hello world, I'm Huynh Nhan Quoc

A **dreamy indie-stack developer**, wandering through code and weaving dreams.
I explore algorithms and ideas, turning curiosity and passion into open source projects.

I’m in love with **Golang & JavaScript**, using them as brushes to paint small sparks into creations that matter.


## 🌸 Kit Module – My Little Home

**Kit Module** is where my ideas take shape.
Each kit, each module beats with the rhythm of my heart 💓
A step on my journey of **open coding** – sometimes clumsy, sometimes playful, always sincere.

It’s my way of sharing dreams with the world –
one line of code, one module, one kit at a time.


## 🌱 Planting Seeds

I plant seeds from **code, ideas, and open source**,
hoping they will bloom one day into flowers for the world 🌼.

Even the smallest contribution can inspire
or spark someone else’s dream.


## 💻 My Tech Playground

* **Languages & Stack:** Golang, JavaScript, PostgreSQL
* **Passions:** Open source, indie-stack development, experimentation
* **Current Focus:** Growing **Kit Module** as a playground for ideas and tiny projects

## ✨ Philosophy

I am a **dreamer**.
I choose to write my dreams in code – curious, sometimes clumsy, always independent.

Each line, each module, each kit is a **heartbeat of passion**,
a step in a journey of freedom, creativity, and shared discovery.

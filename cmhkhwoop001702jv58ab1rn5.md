### I Still Remember the First Lines of Code I Wrote for My Own Platform

When the world already had **WordPress**, **Shopify**, **Laravel**, **Flask**, **Spring**, and countless others —  
I chose my own path.  
I started building a platform from scratch with **Golang** (a language from Google).

Looking back, it was probably foolish.  
Those first days were rough — constant rewrites, confusion, countless restarts.  
But I kept going, because somewhere between frustration and curiosity, I found joy.

I had already written code in **Angular** and many other frameworks,  
but eventually, I decided to walk alone — with **Vanilla JS**.

I’m a stubborn person. I like to handle things my own way,  
even if that means it’s harder.  
Out there, there are millions of people doing different things —  
but I gave two years (and more) to this dream.

I’ve done delivery gigs, freelance work, websites, Facebook ads —  
anything to fund my passion.  
I’ve written endless lines of **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Golang**, and **HTML**.  
I designed everything myself, paid for my own servers — all for my little cloud of dreams.

> “You don’t have to be great to start.  
> But you have to start to be great.”

I don’t argue with existing platforms.  
I simply chose my own path.

### One Day I Thought About Affiliate Marketing

Out of nowhere, it hit me —  
why not make money online, like the first days I fell in love with the web?

I remembered my early blogging days on **Blogspot** — tinkering, learning from tutorials,  
copying snippets of **CSS** and **HTML** from other people’s themes,  
and feeling ecstatic when it finally worked.

That was my first introduction to **MMO** (Make Money Online).  
I read everything I could find — tutorials, forums, guides —  
and taught myself bit by bit.  
No mentor, no guidance, just persistence.

But eventually, I gave up for a while — because I wasn’t making any money.  
I tried everything — URL shorteners, ad views — but never earned a single dollar.  
And even now, technically, I still haven’t withdrawn a dime from MMO.  
But this time… I have direction.  
I have skills.

### The First Signs of Hope from MMO

There was a moment when I thought:  
*Maybe it’s better to just get a job.*  
Because my server couldn’t handle what I was doing.

Just two weeks ago, I was running **20 websites** on a **1-core, 1GB RAM VPS**.  
Then came the moment I went public with **Samdy** — and the system hit its limits.

I didn’t want to abandon it halfway.  
But I realized maybe I needed to take on some work for a while —  
to let **Google** learn what I was building.

**Samdy.vn** was my first real MMO project.  
It started showing small signs of life — about **~20,000 VND/day**,  
just enough to pay for the VPS.  
But it gave me hope.

I told myself: I’ll work a bit more, earn money,  
and use it to fuel this dream —  
to pay for my servers, to pay for my future.

Over the past three months, Samdy learned **100,000 products**.  
In one more year, I want it to reach **1,000,000**.  
That’s the goal — a small dream turning into something real.

> I still remember those days — the ones filled with my very first lines of code.  
> I can’t even count how many times I deleted and rewrote them.  
> Sometimes they were clumsy, sometimes stupid — but they were mine, and that made me happy.

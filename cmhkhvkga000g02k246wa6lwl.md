## ⚙️ Golang &amp; The Dream of Building My Own Platform

I’m an **Indie Web Developer**— a lone builder chasing the dream of creating something meaningful without funding, without a team, and without loud marketing.

I learn, I build, I deploy, I break things, I fix them again. I keep my servers alive, find ways to monetize what I create, and document every small victory and failure along the way.

When I first picked up **Golang**, I wasn’t just trying to build another website. I wanted to build a **platform**.

Before that, I used Angular — but it drove me crazy when it came to SEO. Optimizing a JavaScript framework website for search engines was a nightmare, especially when I didn’t fully understand **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** yet.

Things started to click when I discovered **Next.js**, **GatsbyJS**, and the **JAMstack** philosophy. Around 2019, I managed to bring one of my static websites to the **#1 spot on Google** — and that was when I realized something powerful:

> Static websites are SEO beasts.

But I didn’t want to stop there. I wanted something more **dynamic, flexible, and powerful** — something that could combine the speed of static sites with the interactivity of dynamic systems.

That’s how I began designing my own architecture — a hybrid I called **“Dynamic Stack Web”** — blending static and dynamic rendering, harnessing both client and server power to achieve SEO efficiency without sacrificing performance.

And of course, I wrote it all in **Golang** — a language that, to me, represents clarity, control, and scalability.

## 💻 The Indie Hacker Way — Learn, Build, Survive

As an indie hacker, I don’t have a company, a boss, or deadlines — just me and my code.

I don’t have funding, so I pay for my **domains**, rent my **VPS**, and maintain my **infrastructure** using whatever small income I make online.

By day I delivered food as a **shipper**. By night I coded.  
No mentors. No community. Just documentation, curiosity, and a stubborn will to figure things out.

At first, I thought I’d make money by freelancing — building websites for clients.  
But then I asked myself:

> “Why not build something of my own?”

And that’s how I discovered **Affiliate Marketing**.

## 🌍 Samdy.vn — When an Indie Hacker Creates Real Value

I used what I knew about **SEO**, **Golang**, **data**, and **user behavior** to build **Samdy.vn** — a **price comparison website** that aggregates data from Vietnam’s biggest e-commerce platforms: **Shopee, Tiki, and Lazada**.

No ad budget. No marketing team.  
I seeded the content manually — sharing links across **Facebook groups**, **forums**, and **communities**.

Then one day, traffic came in.  
Someone clicked. Someone bought something.

And I earned **14,000₫ (~$0.50)**.

It wasn’t much, but it was everything. It proved that my system *worked*.

A month later — 500,000₫.  
Then 1.7 million.  
Eventually, **Samdy peaked at 10 million VND/month (~$400)**.

Every click, every sale, every line of code — it all felt like magic.

## ⚠️ Growth, Trade-offs, and Lessons Learned

As traffic grew, I made a critical mistake:

I was running **Samdy** and **20 other websites** on a **single VPS** — 1 Core CPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD.

When traffic spiked, the server choked.  
The site slowed down.  
Users left.

That’s when I realized how little I knew about **infrastructure optimization**, **VPS management**, and **scaling systems**.

But instead of quitting, I turned that pain into knowledge.

Now, the e-commerce landscape is changing.  
Crawlers are restricted, SEO algorithms are AI-driven, and data scraping is tougher than ever.

Yet, what I’ve learned remains **priceless** — because lessons built on failure stick forever.

## 🏆 From a Lone Developer to Vietnam’s Top 100 E-Commerce Websites

No growth hacks.  
No ads.  
No investor money.

Just pure **code-driven SEO**.

Within **6–8 months**, **Samdy.vn** ranked among **Vietnam’s Top 100 e-commerce websites** — built entirely from scratch, powered by **Golang** and a relentless belief in self-reliance.

But the real success wasn’t the ranking.  
It was the understanding that:

> Persistence matters more than speed.
> 
> Learning from failure is more valuable than short-term wins.
> 
> Technologies change every day — but problem-solving mindset never goes out of style.

Today, I’m still an indie hacker, still building, still learning — but I’m not rushing anymore.

I know now that moving slowly, steadily, and purposefully is the only sustainable way to grow.

I might never build a million-dollar startup,  
but I’m a happy indie hacker —  
because I’m creating real value with my own hands and mind.

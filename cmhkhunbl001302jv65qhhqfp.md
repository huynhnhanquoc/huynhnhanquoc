## 🌱 From the First Lines of Code to a Bigger Question

In 2020, amid the chaos of the pandemic, I left **Đà Nẵng** and returned home — starting again from zero.  
At that time, I worked as a **shipper** to make ends meet. But during every spare moment, I kept learning — coding, studying **SEO**, and exploring **Affiliate Marketing**.

No mentor. No formal training.  
Just curiosity, passion, and one question that wouldn’t leave me alone:

> “How can I build a system that creates value — even while I sleep?”

## 💡 Affiliate Marketing — The Doorway to System Thinking

I started with **Accesstrade**, building simple blog sites to share products, write SEO content, and optimize for traffic.  
My first commissions were tiny — just a few cents — but to me, they were proof:  
The **system worked**.  
It could grow. It could scale.

So I taught myself everything:

- How to optimize SEO
- How to track conversions
- How to write code to automate processes
- How to manage traffic and user experience

Then I built **Samdy.vn** — a **price comparison website** built entirely with **Golang**.  
No ads. No team. Just me — with a systems mindset.

Revenue grew from **₫14,000/month** to **₫10 million/month** — not by luck, but through constant optimization of **every line of code**, every **data flow**, every **tiny bottleneck**.

## 🔧 KITMODULE — Building Freedom, One Module at a Time

I didn’t want to just “build websites that make money.”  
I wanted to create a **platform** — a foundation where anyone could deploy **affiliate, marketing, payment, tracking**, and **data systems** using flexible, modular components.

That’s how **KITMODULE** was born.

Based on the philosophy of **“Modular SaaS”**, I built each module to be independent yet perfectly composable — strong on its own, stronger together.

- Affiliate tracking module
- Commission &amp; auto-payment module
- Landing page &amp; tracking module
- Data analytics module

And more to come…

Everything written in **Golang**, **Fiber**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Vanilla JS** —  
lightweight, high-performance, scalable, and open for integration.

## 📣 Sharing Both Wins and Stumbles

I’ve been building **in public** since day one.  
Not just the highlights — but the long nights of debugging, the crashes when the server hit overload, the moments of doubt when I questioned it all.

Because I believe:  
**Honest sharing inspires more than success ever could.**

You don’t need to live in a big city.  
You don’t need capital or approval to chase your dream.  
You just need to **begin** — with a line of code, an idea, and perseverance.

## 🌍 The Future I Dream — Technological Independence

I dream of a digital world built by small dreamers —  
a world where people can **create systems, products, and ecosystems** with their own hands, free from dependency.

A world where **freedom, creativity, and ownership** belong to individuals, not corporations.

**KITMODULE** isn’t just a tech project.  
It’s my way of contributing to a larger dream:

- Helping businesses deploy affiliate systems easily
- Enabling freelancers to build their own tools
- Allowing agencies to manage multiple campaigns
- And giving newcomers a place to start their own tech journey

## ☕️ From a Cup of Coffee, From a Single Module

I wrote my first lines of code at **Hoa House Café** —  
a small coffee shop where I brewed coffee by hand and coded my dreams between refills.

Today, I still write.  
But it’s no longer *just my dream* I’m writing for.

I write so that **you** can start too.  
So that you see how **small modules**, when built with enough patience and imagination, can connect into something vast.  
So that together, we can **build an independent digital world — one crafted by Vietnamese hands.**

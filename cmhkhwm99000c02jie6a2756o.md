## 🌙 Saturday Night Code

Last night was a Saturday.  
I pushed new code for **Kitbuy** at around 2 AM.

No boss.  
No deadline.  
Just me, my laptop, and the quiet hum of thought.

Because for me, coding isn’t work — it’s how I live.

I’m a **Golang Indie Hacker**,  
and that means sometimes I have to write code on Sundays.

While the world rushes toward *No Code*, *Low Code*, and *AI stacks*,  
I’m still here — a farmer tilling the code fields by hand.

I’m not against AI, but I also refuse to hand over my thinking to it.

Those who truly succeed with AI all share one thing in common:  
They’ve failed before.  
They’re not lazy thinkers.  
They’ve learned how to think deeply.

But then there are others — chasing shortcuts, hoping technology will think for them.

People talk about *brain rot* — the decay of thought.  
But to me, the real danger is *brain bot* — developers who let AI think in their place.

I don’t judge.  
I just believe:

> “The core of programming is thought.  
> The core of being human is thinking.”

## ✨ The Chance of a Dreamer

I didn’t start coding because of some grand childhood dream.

I was good at math, but numbers never made me feel anything.  
It wasn’t until ninth grade, standing in a quiet room, counting tiles on the floor,  
that I realized I loved to think — to see patterns in the abstract.

Everything in life has a beginning,  
and mine came from somewhere unexpected: **the military.**

While serving, I met an officer who sparked my curiosity about programming.  
After leaving the army, I started learning HTML and CSS on my own.  
That was where the journey began.

As Vietnamese composer Trúc Phương once said:

> “Everything is material for life.”

And maybe, for me — **programming is the material of my life.**

## 💔 Failure, Return, and an Unfinished Dream

I once tried to start a company.  
And I failed.

I thought I was building something great,  
but after it collapsed, I went back to my hometown — broke, starting from zero.

I did whatever I could to survive while keeping the dream alive:

- Delivering packages to make ends meet.
- Building small websites to keep my server online.
- Doing affiliate marketing to pay the bills.

Back then, I stopped chasing success or fame.  
Just being able to live by my own code was enough.

But inside, one dream still burned quietly:

> “The dream of technological independence.”

I started coding in **2015**.  
Almost ten years later, I look back and see a stubborn fool — but a fool who never quit.

Some people say I’m crazy for spending five years building a web framework only I use.  
Maybe they’re right.  
But I still love it — the code, and the version of myself who believed it was worth it.

Some build a website in five days.  
I’ve spent **five years**, and my dream still isn’t done.

I once said — and I don’t need anyone to understand:

> “I go against the wind not because I’m a kite,  
> but because I’m a lonely bird.”

Maybe you’ll meet me, and I won’t say hello. Forgive me.  
I might be there, but my mind’s already floating somewhere in the cloud.

## 🌀 Golang — More Than a Language

Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into pure algorithms.  
They make me think, stretch, and rewire my mind.

My favorite language? **Golang.**

It forces me to rethink the simplest things —  
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

It’s no longer just a programming language.  
It’s a **way of life**.

You might say I’m stubborn — with Rust, Vlang, Python, Node.js out there.  
But I’m not here to argue about languages.

Because for me:

> **Mindset matters more than syntax.**  
> **Philosophy matters more than frameworks.**

Someone once asked me,

> “Why go to university?”

I replied,

> “To learn philosophy — and how to approach problems.”

I don’t have a degree.  
And I don’t need a mouse pad with a university logo on it.

## 🔁 Programming — A Journey With No End

Programming is a lot like life itself.

It has **if**, **else**, **while**, and **with** —  
just like the loops and conditions we all go through.

When we leave school, we dream of oceans.  
When we come home, we dream of something smaller — but closer to the heart.

Whether or not we become successful doesn’t matter.  
What matters is what ten years of youth — and five years of code — have taught us.

In **2018–2019**, when everything fell apart,  
I thought about quitting — going home, finding a quiet job.

But somehow, I went back to the city.  
Kept learning Go.  
Kept tinkering.  
Kept writing code that no one taught me.

And when the code finally ran, I smiled for the whole day.

I write about *Indie Hackers*,  
but I always call myself a **Golang Indie Hacker**.

Because just saying *Indie Hacker* feels too practical, too focused on money.

I love **Golang** because it confuses me.  
I love **Indie Hacking** because it keeps me innocent.

Technology changes every day.  
But my passion stays the same.

And that’s enough.

It’s a beautiful day.  
And I’m still here — writing code.

If the clouds still hold a bit of sunlight,  
then I know I’m still lucky. 🌤

From a failed startup to returning home empty-handed, I kept building my dream — five years spent crafting a personal web framework no one else used.  
But that’s okay. Because for me, Golang isn’t just a tool. It’s a **lifestyle**.

Programming is a journey with no finish line.  
And every day I still get to code is a beautiful day.
